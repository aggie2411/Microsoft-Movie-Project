## Overview

A one-paragraph overview of the project, including the business problem, data, methods, results and recommendations.

## Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I have been charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create and what they should keep in mind as they enter into a new and highly competitive sector.

## Data

Data has been provided from the following sources:

* [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/)
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
* [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
* [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
* [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/)


These datasets provide many different pieces of information for thousands of movies - movie budget, gross and domestic revenue, review ratings, release dates etc. 

## Methods

I will utilise descriptive data analysis techniques to try and infer relationships between variables within each dataset. I will also create new variables such as profit and Return on Investment in an attempt to determine best investment opportunities for Microsoft.

I will try and answer the following:

* Which are the most profitable movies ever?

* Is there a good time to release a movie?

* Is there a specific genre that should be prioritised?

* Does making a highly rated movie really impact potential profits?

* Who could direct a direct a highly rated movie for Microsoft?


## Results

Present your key results. For Phase 1, this will be findings from your descriptive analysis.

***
Questions to consider:
* How do you interpret the results?
* How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
***

Here is an example of how to embed images from your sub-folder:

## Conclusions

Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.

***
Questions to consider:
* What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
* What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
* What else could you do in the future to improve this project?
